I volunteered for three years (2019, 2021â€“2022) at the STEM4Girls summer camp as a course instructor for girls aged 5 to 11. I designed and co-hosted the following sessions:

* **Programming Workshop (2020):** Introduced programming concepts using Python. The workshop covered variables, operators, logical operators, and loops. The campers worked on a fun project to design a smart solution for garbage collection in the City of Markham.

* **Logical Thinking Workshop (2019):** Focused on making math engaging through fun puzzles. The activities encouraged creative problem-solving and teamwork.
