Hello! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/) and affiliated with the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/). My research focuses on **sustainability as a first-order optimization objective** alongside **efficiency** in large-scale machine learning and data center systems. Broadly, I'm interested in:
1. Machine learning systems  
2. Data center computing  
3. Distributed systems  

Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my Master‚Äôs degree at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was very fortunate to work with Prof. [Akshitha Sriraman](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asrirama/). My Master‚Äôs research centered on developing sustainable resource management techniques for microservices in hyperscale data centers. 

I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering. While there, I was advised by Prof. [Steve Mann](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/mann-s/) on wearables for prosopagnosia. In between my academic pursuits, I spent ~3 years as a software engineer at IBM working on Db2 database core engine development, specifically on availability features such as backup, restore, and recovery.

Please feel free reach out for research, collaborations, or a casual chat, especially if you are a junior, disadvantaged, or underrepresented student. The best way to reach me is via email:
**[melissapan]@berkeley.edu**


**CV**: [PDF here](../files/cv_2024.pdf), up to Dec 2024.
